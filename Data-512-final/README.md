# DATA_512_final

I would like to work on a project to classify toxic comments using machine learning/deep learning techniques and assess the effect of skewed distribution of annotators on the model performance..

The dataset I am using will be this [dataset](https://figshare.com/projects/Wikipedia_Talk/16731) which was used in our assignment 2.

I hope to learn techniques about NLP and know more about human-centered data science after doing this project.

For more details, please check the [notebook](final_project_proposal.ipynb)
