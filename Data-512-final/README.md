# DATA_512_final

I would like to work on a project to classify toxic comments using machine learning/deep learning techniques.

The dataset I am using will be this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data) from Kaggle.

I hope to learn techniques about NLP and know more about human-centered data science after doing this project.

For more details, please check the [notebook](final_project_preliminary_proposal.ipynb)
